<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Monika D A, a passionate and driven student  from India. 
  Every day, I strive to push the boundaries of technology and innovation.

 
  
  <p> But my life isn't all about textbooks and lab reportsâ€”I am also a huge movie buff. 
    Watching movies and TV series is my escape and my joy. 
    I love diving into different genres and exploring the stories they tell.
     From thrilling mysteries to touching dramas and epic fantasies,
      I find a deep appreciation for the art of storytelling.</p>

<p>Balancing the rigorous demands of my studies with my love for cinema creates a dynamic and fulfilling life.
   I like to think of myself as not just a student, but a storyteller too, bridging the gap between the technical world and the creative world.  </p></p>
